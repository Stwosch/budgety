# Budgety

This is my budget application, that uses mainly:
- HTML5
- SASS
- JavaScript (ES6)
- jQuery
- PHP
- mySQL
- Ajax

To run this app you must import database "kanciantus.sql" and put files on server (I used XAMPP during production).

Access data are in 'config.php' file, so if you will some problems with connect to database, check username and password in the configuration file.
